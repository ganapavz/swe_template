How to assemble cbui-qgov-assets-lib from the QGov Online templates.

History
- 13/09/2012 updated for version 2.3.0 of the QGov Online templates

Download the template zip file from 
https://www.govdex.gov.au/confluence/display/SSQSWE/Download+template
(you need a govdex login) and extract the
qgov-template.zip\www.qld.gov.au\assets\v2\
directory.

Do a comparison with the v2 folder of the last version of templates (to see what changes there are).

1. Copy flash directory (if there are changes) to 
src\main\resources\META-INF\resources\qgov\flash

2. Copy images directory (except jquery-ui) to 
src\main\resources\META-INF\resources\qgov\images

3. Copy script directory to
src\main\resources\META-INF\resources\qgov\script
but delete all scripts not listed below:
ie-layout.js
init.js
loader.js
qgov.js
qgov-environment.js

4. Update qgov-environment.js by adding the following to the production environments array (currently 'b' in the minified js)
"https://www.service.transport.qld.gov.au"

5. Update all scripts that refer to qg.swe.paths.assets (or a.swe.paths.assets or similar) to add 
qg.swe.paths.assetsSuffix (or similar) on the end of the URL 
(this property is setup in the page template, and is required for the javascript to load resources via the JSF URL). 
This is really really painful to update (it's easiest to search for 'assets' in the scripts) - but there was only 14 occurences last time.

6. Copy style directory to
src\main\resources\META-INF\resources\qgov\style
but delete all stylesheets not listed below:
layout-large.css
layout-medium.css
qgov.css
qgov-ie.css

7. Using the latest version of Notepad++ (which supports the non-greedy ? operator) update (use the 'Find in Files' feature!)
the URL's to JSF style by replacing regex
url\("?(?:\.\.|/assets/v2)/images/(.+?)"?\)
with
url\("#{resource['qgov:images/$1']}"\)

8. Remove the button related styles in qgov.css by replacing regex
form button,\.actions \.button.*?(\.invalid \.alert)
with
$1

9. Remove the fieldset and legend related styles in qgov.css by replacing regex
fieldset\{.*?(label\{)
with
$1
