<p>The list of our ICT-enabled initiatives, their investment objectives, status, budget and timeframes is available below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Red—initiatives that are forecasted to, or have exceeded tolerances.</li>
	<li>Amber—initiatives that are still within tolerance, but pushing the bounds.</li>
	<li>Green—everything is to plan and the initiatives are within tolerance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Budgets (original and revised total estimated expenditure amounts) may be reported as zero due to final budget approval pending.</p>
