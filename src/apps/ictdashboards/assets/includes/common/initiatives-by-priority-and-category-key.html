<p>Our ICT-enabled initiatives are prioritised as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>critical</strong>&mdash;mandatory initiatives essential to the delivery of Queensland Government objectives, major legislative or ministerial requirements, or major policy initiatives with very high risk, complexity, cost and benefits </li>
<li><strong>high</strong>&mdash;important initiatives but not essential to major legislative or policy initiatives with high risk, complexity, cost and benefits</li>
<li><strong>medium</strong>&mdash;initiatives with relatively high attractiveness and achievability scores but that do not fall within the definition of critical or high initiatives</li>
<li><strong>low</strong>&mdash;initiatives which improve business efficiency and management effectiveness with low cost, risk and benefits.</li>
</ul>
