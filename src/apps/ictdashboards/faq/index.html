</ul><h2><a name="what_are_ict_dashboards"></a>What are the Queensland Government ICT dashboards?</h2>
<p>A Queensland Government ICT dashboard site has been established which contains dashboards for all 21 agencies. The aim of this site is to enable both the public and private sector to view the details and status of this government&rsquo;s significant information and communication technology (ICT) investments online with the ability to track their progress over time.</p>
<p>Agency chief information officers (CIOs) or other authorised officers are responsible for evaluating and approving the release of data on a regular basis, which is accomplished through interfaces provided by the ICT dashboards.</p>
<h2><a name="why_ict_dashboard_launched"></a>Why were the ICT dashboards launched?</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2013 Executive Government approved the Queensland Government Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Strategy 2013&ndash;17.</p>
<p>The strategy is a key contributor to the broader public service renewal agenda and describes the vision for the future of ICT in the Queensland Government. It also addresses the Queensland Commission of Audit and ICT Audit recommendations.</p>
<p>The strategy outlines the need for information to be easily accessible, visible and available for reuse by the public in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
<p>The ICT dashboards provide interested parties with access to pertinent&nbsp;information government uses to oversee the performance of its investments.</p>
<p>This openness and transparency will make it easier to identify underperforming projects and focus action on the initiatives that need it most.</p>
<h2><a name="intended_audience"></a>Who is the intended audience?</h2>
<p>The ICT dashboards enable all agencies (be local, state or federal), industry, the general public and other stakeholders (including international) to view details of the state&rsquo;s ICT significant investments.</p>
<h2><a name="what_information_displayed"></a>What information does the ICT dashboards display?</h2>
<p>The ICT dashboards display a subset of data from agency investment information (their portfolio) reported by agencies to their internal governance committees. This data includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>high-level overview</strong>&mdash;a summary of the Queensland Government&rsquo;s initiatives, including current stages and budget</li>
<li><strong>initiatives by business unit / category</strong>&mdash;the number of active initiatives and their original total estimated expenditure by business unit / category</li>
<li><strong>implementation partners</strong>&mdash;a list of our internal and external partners for visibility of who is assisting us in delivering our ICT-enabled initiatives</li>
<li><strong>current status</strong>&mdash;the status of initiatives in relation to timeframe, cost and quality parameters</li>
<li><strong>priority</strong>&mdash;the priority rating (critical, high, medium or low) attributed to initiatives by business unit / category </li>
<li><strong>initiatives</strong>&mdash;the names of all our ICT-enabled initiatives, their investment objectives, budget and timeframes, as well as explanation for the ones reporting red or amber status.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Departmental dashboards</h3>
<p>The following departments released data on their individual dashboards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and Multicultural Affairs</li>
<li>Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</li>
<li>Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services</li>

<h2><a name="what_information_included"></a>What information is included on the ICT dashboards?</h2>
<p>The ICT dashboards display pertinent information on each agency&rsquo;s current ICT-enabled initiatives.</p>
<h2><a name="display_data_to_public"></a>Do the ICT dashboards show the public all data submitted by agencies?</h2>
<p>Although a key goal of the ICT dashboards is to improve accountability and performance through transparency, not all data compiled is suitable for public release. Processes have been put into place to ensure sensitive information will not be publicly displayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data which the ICT dashboards do not share with the public:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>forward budget</strong>&mdash;planned ICT spending levels for the financial year</li>
<li><strong>completed initiatives</strong>&mdash;costs of initiatives and activities that are finalised/implemented</li>
<li><strong>national security or classified data</strong>&mdash;the ICT dashboards do not collect or display any classified or national security-sensitive information</li>
<li><strong>procurement-sensitive data</strong>&mdash;any data related to government&rsquo;s procurement that, if released to the public would adversely impact the government's negotiating position, is considered procurement sensitive.</li>
<li><strong>accountable/responsible officers</strong>&mdash;individual government and/or implementation partner(s) will not be identified or published.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="agencies_submit_data"></a>How do agencies submit the core data which supports the ICT dashboards?</h2>
<p>All agency-related ICT dashboards information is captured in an Excel spreadsheet which is saved as a CSV file and uploaded onto Open Data.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="data_refreshed"></a>How often is the data refreshed?</h2>
<p>Agencies should provide an update to their initiatives' activities and operational performance when the activities occur or when performance metrics are measured.</p>
<p>Updates to this site will be determined by each agency's internal governance processes. For instance, the Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts will provide refreshed data every 6 weeks, as approved by the designated governance board at its 6-weekly meeting. Other agencies will refresh their data in line with their governance board approval which can be monthly, every 6 weeks, every 2 months or quarterly.</p>
<h2><a name="who_can_update_agency_info"></a>Who can update agency information on the ICT dashboards?</h2>
<p>Only agency-authorised users have access to submit updates to the ICT dashboard.</p>
<h2><a name="what_is_status_colour"></a>What does red, amber or green (RAG) mean under the overall status heading?</h2>
<p>This is known as the RAG status:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>red</strong>&mdash;there are serious issues and/or risks that are currently impacting the initiative right now probably leading to delays, quality impact or significant budget overruns</li>
<li><strong>amber</strong>&mdash;there are potential issues and/or risks with schedule or budget that will impact the initiative if not corrected (at risk of not delivering on time/cost/quality but may be saved with corrective action)</li>
<li><strong>green</strong>&mdash;everything is to plan, within tolerance and expected to meet the agreed timeframes, budget, and/or quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of the dashboards, the RAG status covers time, cost and quality and is reported at the highest level of all the elements. For example, if <strong>cost </strong>and <strong>quality</strong> are green, and <strong>time</strong> is red then the RAG status would be illustrated as red.</p>
<h2><a name="public_status_colour_red"></a>Will the public have insight into why the RAG status is being displayed as red?</h2>
<p>Yes.&nbsp;Initiatives showing a red or amber status will be required to provide an explanation regarding this status.</p>
<h2><a name="planned_new_features"></a>Are there any new features planned for the ICT dashboards?</h2>
<p>The Queensland Government is always looking for ways to improve analytical capabilities and user experience. User feedback is always appreciated and can be submitted for consideration via the feedback links located on this site.</p>
<h2><a name="further_information"></a>How can I obtain further information relating to an <span style="white-space:nowrap">initiative(s)</span> highlighted on the ICT dashboards site?</h2>
<p>Anyone is permitted to ask government for further information relating to a particular initiative(s).&nbsp;All requests for information, however, must be made through the appropriate channels.</p>
<p>Each department has a Right to Information (RTI) officer that will be able to assist you with your enquiry, particularly if the information is accessible through an administrative release process or if you need to make an RTI or information privacy (IP) request to access it.</p>
<p>For further information relating to the RTI process, as well as a list of the relevant departmental RTI officers, please visit the Queensland Government&nbsp;<a href="http://www.qld.gov.au/about/rights-accountability/right-to-information/">Right to information website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important:&nbsp;</strong>You may not seek further information relating to an initiative via the feedback link located on this site.&nbsp; Consequently, any requests for information received by agencies will not be processed.</p></div>
