	<h2>When you <em>think</em> your child has a disability</h2>
	<p>There’s been no diagnosis but you have a gut feeling: your child is ‘different’.
	It’s not just that your child isn’t keeping up with other babies or toddlers: it’s that something just doesn’t feel right.</p>
	<p>Believe in yourself. 
	Don’t dismiss your feelings. 
	As the saying goes, ‘don’t leave a stone unturned’ in searching out what might be behind that gut feeling. 
	The first thing you need to do is make an appointment with your doctor to request a referral to a paediatrician or specialist.</p>
