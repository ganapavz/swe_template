<h2>Who else can I contact?</h2>
<p>You might already know about a recreation activity that you enjoy, or you might be interested in trying a new activity. Community organisations may coordinate recreation programs that suit your interests and needs.</p>

You can watch a video about the CPL's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOLIQgTEC1c&amp;list=UU891T_ulpwy_5WuuZGwF2eA&amp;feature=plcp">recreation and leisure program</a> on its YouTube channel.</p>
<p>The Community Living Program, which is overseen by the <a href="http://communityliving.org.au/">Community Living Association</a> in Brisbane, also coordinates an adventure holiday group. Some of its members have shared their experiences about participating in the <a href="http://www.qld.gov.au/disability/out-and-about/sport-groups/adventure-holidays/index.html">adventure holiday group</a> with Disability Online.</p>
