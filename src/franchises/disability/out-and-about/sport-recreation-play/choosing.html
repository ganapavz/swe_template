<h1>Sport</h1>
<!--#include virtual="/assets/includes/global/page-options-pre.html"--><h2>How can I find a sport that is right for me?</h2>
<p>Finding a sport, or a type of physical activity, that is right for you is a personal choice. You may already have some idea about a sport that you'd like to try, or you might be willing to give a new sport a try for the first time.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what">What sports can I choose from?</a></li>
<li><a href="#right">How can I work out what sport I might enjoy?</a></li>
<li><a href="#other">What other physical activities can I get involved in?</a></li>
<li><a href="/disability/out-and-about/sport-recreation-play/involved.html">How can I get involved in sport in other ways?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="#what"></a>Choosing a sport</h2>
<p>Here are some resources that can help you with choosing a sport:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sporting Wheelies has an <a href="http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/our-services/sport/79">A to Z guide about sports</a> that includes information about a wide range of sporting activities you may be interested in.</li>
<li>Australian Athletes with a Disability has information about a variety of <a href="http://www.sports.org.au/sports.html">sports</a>-including archery, athletics, boccia, cycling, football, lawn bowls, powerlifting and wheelchair fencing-for people with a disability.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.paralympic.org.au/sports-and-classifications/wizard">Select-A-Sport tool</a> by the Australian Paralympic Committee can help you work out different Paralympic Sports you may be eligible to compete in-depending on your disability.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="#right"></a>Making the right choice</h2>
<p>The right physical activity or sport for you will depend on your own interests and goals, as well as your disability and access to different sporting options.</p>
<p>The Better Health Channel has a guide, <a href="http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/physical_activity_what's_right_for_you?open">Physical activity-choosing the one for you</a>, that can help you with deciding how you can make exercise an enjoyable part of your life.</p>
<p>Sporting Wheelies offers <a href="http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/our-services/sport/78">Come and Try Days</a> around Queensland during the year that you can participate in to see if you enjoy a particular sport.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><a name="#other"></a>Other physical activities</h2>
<p>Regular exercise doesn't need to involve sport. There are other physical activities that you can participate in to enjoy the benefits of leading a healthy and active lifestyle.</p>
<p>You can think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>joining a gym or starting an exercise program. Sporting Wheelies has an accessible <a href="http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/our-services/fitness-and-rehabilitation/89">gym</a> at its Brisbane headquarters. Sporting Wheelies can also help you with beginning an exercise program, as well as finding a local gym that suits your needs. Contact details for its <a href="http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/contact-us/form/2?random=0">offices around Queensland</a> are available online. The Queensland Government's <a href="http://www.healthier.qld.gov.au/healthy-living/fitness">Healthier Queensland website</a> includes exercise programs and other fitness advice.</li>
<li>finding an exercise buddy and helping each other stay fit and active in different ways, like gardening, playing with pets or participating in recreation</li>
<li>doing physical activity on your own. Even tasks like household chores can provide an opportunity for you to participate in incidental exercise, and improve your overall health.</li>
