	<h2>Turning 18?</h2>
	<p>If your child has <a href="foo">impaired decision-making capabilities</a>,
	you may want a formal decision-maker to be appointed for them when they turn 18 years old.</p>
	<p>You can apply to Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) for this 
	when your child is 17 years and 6 months old. 
	The appointment of a Guardian and/or Administrator can commence on your child’s 18th birthday.</p>
	<h3>Why this is important</h3>
	<p>Once your child turns 18, banks, for example, 
	may not let you deal with your child’s personal bank account unless you are a legally appointed Administrator.</p>
