								<h1>About the portal</h1>
								<!--#include virtual="/assets/includes/global/page-options-pre.html"-->

								<h2>How the  portal delivers transparent and consistent information on Government investment  in front line service delivery</h2>
								<p>The Queensland Government Investment Portal provides a high-level static summary of data on grant and funding programs. It enables effective searching of front line services by client groups and local government areas, as well as keyword searches.</p>
								<p>The Portal  is an initiative of the <a href="http://www.treasury.qld.gov.au/clients/community/social-services-reform/index.shtml">Social  Services Reform Program</a>, which is working across Government to drive  sustainable services and value for money investment.</p>
								<p>This evolving  program of reform represents a significant transformation exercise to deliver best practice approaches to  Government investment and a better way of doing business.</p>

								<h2>What information is available?</h2>

								<p>The Portal includes data on whole of Government investment (ie. expenditure) relating to grant and funding programs for front line services from 2013-14 and data on more specific social service program delivery from 2012-13. </p>
								<p>The portal will be updated to provide key information on Government investment in front line service delivery in two report formats:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>expenditure records for previous financial years (ending 30 June)</li>
									<li>available funding records for the current financial year including budgeted and uncommitted or unallocated funds. </li>
								</ul>
								<p>As the data reflects monies paid for programs at the time of reporting, figures and other details may be subject to change. This means that comparison of figures across different years may be ineffective due to program name changes or consolidation of funding into other programs. Budgeted and expenditure amounts may also be subject to variation due to changes in project timing, scope or funding reallocations.</p>
								<p>Where individuals have received funding, these details arehave been aggregated within broader program or funding categories, in order to protectmaintain their privacy.</p>

								<p>Expenditure records available via this portal generally report:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>legal entity and service provider details, including ABN where applicable</li>
									<li>Government agency providing funding </li>

									<li>funding or program name</li>
									<li>funding details, including type, duration and term</li>
									<li>details regarding the purpose and nature of the funding</li>
									<li>where available and appropriate, the local government area in which the service is provided</li>
									<li>total funding for each service provider or grant recipient and the amount paid in the financial year.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Available funding records</h2>
								<p>Expenditure records available via this portal report:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Government agency providing funding </li>
									<li>funding or program name and purpose</li>
