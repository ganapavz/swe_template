                        <h2>Settlement </h2>
                        <p>Queensland was first seen  by Europeans in the 1600s. Dutch explorer Willem Jansz landed on the Cape York  Peninsula in 1606, and in 1623 Jan Carstens explored the Gulf   of Carpentaria. An Englishman, Lieutenant James Cook, is  acknowledged as the first European to encounter Queensland's east coast in 1770 in HMS <em>Endeavour</em>.</p>
                        <p>Europeans settled in Queensland in 1825 when Brisbane was selected as a  penal settlement for the more difficult convicts. The penal settlement was  officially closed in 1839 and the land was prepared for sale for permanent  settlement.</p>
                        <p>Queensland was originally part of the British-administered colony of  New South Wales. This occupied a large part of the Australian continent.</p>
                        <p>A desire to separate from New South Wales began to emerge as Queensland's  economic significance increased and its productivity and population expanded.  The people of Queensland began to realise the importance of Brisbane as a port  and urban centre.</p>                        
                        <p>The physical remoteness of Queensland from the centre of government in  New South Wales and concern about the maintenance of public infrastructure, contributed  to a desire for independence.</p>

                        <h2>Independence </h2>
                        <p>In 1851, a public meeting was held to consider Queensland's separation  from New South Wales.</p>
                      <p>Queen Victoria granted approval and signed Letters Patent on 6 June 1859  to establish the new colony of Queensland. On the same day, an Order-in-Council  gave Queensland its own constitution. </p>
                        <p>Queensland became a self-governing colony with its own Governor, a  nominated Legislative Council and an elected Legislative Assembly. </p>
                        <p>Queensland Day is celebrated on 6 June, recognising the birth of the state.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Early development </h2>
                        
                        <p>After the separation from New South Wales, towns outside Brisbane began  to develop. In 1860 Ipswich and Rockhampton were officially declared towns.  Maryborough and Warwick followed in the next year.</p>
                        <p>Queensland's first elections were held in 1860. Robert George Wyndham  Herbert led the first elected government as Premier. On 22 May 1860, Queensland  Parliament opened for the first time. Immigration, communications and  development issues broadly occupied Queensland's early politics. The railway  network extended as towns demanded their own link.</p>
                        <p>One of the earliest decisions of the new parliament was to increase the  population of the new colony as rapidly as possible. A land-order system was  devised to attract new settlers. Over the next 3 years, nearly 25,000 people  landed in Queensland attracted by the idea of owning land.</p>
                        <p>The discovery of payable gold near Rockhampton was one of many discoveries  that encouraged development in Queensland and helped to protect the state from  the effects of the 1866 Depression.</p>
                        <p>Queensland pioneered the state secondary education system in the early  1860s when the government subsidised municipalities to set up grammar schoolsâ€”the  first free education in Australia. In 1866, Queensland Treasury banknotes were  issued for the first time.</p>
                        <p>The <em>Constitution  Act 1867</em> defined the formal institutions of government including parliament and  the executive government. </p>
                        <p>In 1876, the current design of the Queensland flag was officially  adopted. Local government was established in 1879 with the passage of the <em>Divisional Boards Act 1879</em>.</p>
                        <p>By 1891, wool had become an enormous industry in Australia. Thousands  of shearers, already dissatisfied with their pay rates and conditions, refused  to work when a Darling Downs Station employed non-union men. When Aborigines,  Kanaka Islanders and Chinese immigrants began working for even cheaper wages,  the potential for revolution dissolved. The strike is remembered as an event  that created camaraderie among Australian workers from all backgrounds and launched  Labor politics. The first branch meeting of the Australian Labor Party is said  to have been held by striking shearers under the gum tree now known as the Tree  of Knowledge in Barcaldine, Queensland, in 1891. </p>
                        <p>As fears were expressed that Aboriginal people in Queensland faced  extinction, the Government decided to establish new governmental reserves to  accommodate the remaining tribes throughout the state. In 1897, the <em>Aboriginal Protection and  Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act</em> was passed, authorising the  removal of Aboriginal people to reserves. These powers of removal continued  until 1971 when the Act was amended.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Federation</h2>                        
                      <p>On 1 January 1901, the union of the Commonwealth of Australia was  created. The majority of Queenslanders voted yes to a referendum asking whether  Queensland should join the Federation. The referendum was passed resulting in  Queensland losing its colonial status and becoming a state.</p>
